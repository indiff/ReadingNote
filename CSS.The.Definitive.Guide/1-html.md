###	Replaced and Nonreplaced Elements

**Replaced elements** are those where the element’s content is replaced by something that is not directly represented by document content.

**Nonreplaced elements** are presented by the user agent (generally a browser) inside a box generated by the element itself.

### Element Display Roles

**Block-level elements** generate an element box that (by default) fills its parent element’s content area and cannot have other elements at its sides.

**Inline-level elements** generate an element box within a line of text and do not break up the flow of that line.
