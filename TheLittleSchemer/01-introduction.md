```clojure
(define atom?
        (lambda (x)
                (and (not (pair? x)) (not (null? x)))))
```

The primitive **cons** takes two arguments.The second argument to cons must be a list.The result is a list.

The primitive **null?** is defined only for lists.

The primitive **eq?** takes two arguments.Each must be a non-numeric atom.
