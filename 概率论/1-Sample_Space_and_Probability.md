# Sample Space and Probability

## Sets

A set is **countably infinite** if it has one-to-one correspondence with the natural number set, $N$.

$\{x| x \text{ satisfies } P\}$ , the symbol "$|$" is to be read as "such that"(满足...条件)

**Uncountable set** There is no injective function from X to the set of natural numbers.

### Set Operations

$$S∪T=\{x|x∈S \text{ or } x∈T\}$$

$$S∩T=\{x|x∈S \text{ and } x∈T\}$$

$$\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty S_n=S_1∪S_2∪\cdots= \{x|x∈S_n \text{for some n}\}$$

$$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty S_n=S_1∩S_2∩\cdots= \{x|x∈S_n \text{for all n}\}$$

Sets and the associated operations are easy to visualize in terms of **Venn Diagram(文森图)**
